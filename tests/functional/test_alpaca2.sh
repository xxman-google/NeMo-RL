# Example 3:
#   Prompt: Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?
#   Baseline model: gpt4_1106_preview
#   Baseline model response: Kickball is a fun and simple game that is similar to baseball or softball, but instead of hitting a ball with a bat, players kick a rubber ball. Here's how the game is typically played:

# **Equipment and Setup:**
# - A large rubber ball (similar to a playground ball).
# - A field with four bases arranged like a diamond (home plate, first base, second base, third base).
# - Teams can vary in size, but 8 to 11 players per team is common.

# **Objective:**
# The objective of kickball is to score more runs than the opposing team by kicking the ball and running around the bases to reach home plate.

# **Basic Rules:**
# 1. **Teams:** There are two teams – the kicking team and the fielding team. The teams switch roles after each inning.

# 2. **Kicking Order:** The kicking team has a lineup that determines the order in which players kick the ball.

# 3. **Pitching:** The pitcher from the fielding team rolls the ball towards home plate. The ball must be rolled smoothly (no bouncing) and within reach of the kicker.

# 4. **Kicking:** The kicker attempts to kick the ball and then run to at least first base. The kicker must kick the ball within the kicking box (an area including and surrounding home plate).

# 5. **Outs:** A player can be put out in several ways, similar to baseball:
#    - **Catch:** If the fielding team catches the ball in the air after it has been kicked (before it touches the ground), the kicker is out.
#    - **Tag:** If a fielder tags a runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base, the runner is out.
#    - **Force Out:** If a fielder has control of the ball and touches the base that a runner is forced to run to before the runner gets there (similar to a force out in baseball), the runner is out.
#    - **Strikeouts:** A kicker can also strike out if they miss the ball three times or if they kick the ball foul on the third strike.

# 6. **Running the Bases:** After kicking the ball, the runner attempts to safely reach a base. Runners can be tagged out by the fielding team or forced out when the fielding team tags the base ahead of the runner.

# 7. **Scoring Runs:** A run is scored when a runner successfully kicks the ball and then touches all four bases in order, ending at home plate.

# 8. **Innings:** An inning consists of both teams having a turn to kick and field. Each team's turn continues until they get three outs, after which the other team gets to kick.

# 9. **Foul Balls:** A kick that lands in foul territory (outside the first or third-base lines) is considered a foul ball. Two fouls count as a strike, and a third foul may result in a strikeout, depending on the rules you are playing with.

# 10. **Game Length:** The game typically lasts for a set number of innings (often five or seven) or until a time limit is reached.

# Remember that kickball is often played casually, and the rules can vary depending on the group you're playing with. Make sure to clarify any specific rules with your sister and her friends before you start playing. Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the game!

#   Prompt: What is some cool music from the 1920s?
#   Baseline model: gpt4_1106_preview
#   Baseline model response: The 1920s, often referred to as the "Roaring Twenties," was a period that saw a significant explosion in the popularity of jazz and the beginning of widespread commercial recording. Here are some influential artists and songs from that era:

# 1. **Louis Armstrong**: Known as "Satchmo" or "Pops," Armstrong was one of the most influential figures in jazz music. His innovative approach to playing the trumpet and his scat singing style were highly influential. Notable recordings include "West End Blues" and "Heebie Jeebies."

# 2. **Bessie Smith**: Dubbed the "Empress of the Blues," Smith was the most popular female blues singer of the decade. Her powerful voice and emotive style brought her great fame. Songs like "Downhearted Blues" and "St. Louis Blues" were among her biggest hits.

# 3. **Duke Ellington**: A pivotal bandleader and composer in jazz, Ellington led his orchestra at the Cotton Club in Harlem. Some of his notable compositions from the 1920s include "Black and Tan Fantasy" and "Mood Indigo."

# 4. **Jelly Roll Morton**: A pianist and composer, Morton claimed to be the inventor of jazz. Whether or not that's true, his influence on the genre is undeniable. His recordings with the Red Hot Peppers, like "King Porter Stomp" and "Black Bottom Stomp," are classics.

# 5. **George Gershwin**: Gershwin was a composer who bridged the gap between classical music and jazz. His 1924 composition "Rhapsody in Blue" is one of the most famous pieces of American music from the 20th century.

# 6. **Paul Whiteman**: Known as the "King of Jazz," Whiteman led one of the most popular dance bands of the 1920s. His orchestra's recording of Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" with Gershwin at the piano was a huge hit.

# 7. **The Original Dixieland Jass Band**: Often credited with making the first jazz recordings in 1917, they continued to be popular through the 1920s with songs like "Dixie Jass Band One-Step" and "Tiger Rag."

# 8. **Ma Rainey**: Another significant blues singer of the era, known as the "Mother of the Blues," her powerful voice and charismatic performances made her a key figure of the blues. Songs like "See See Rider" and "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" were popular.

# 9. **Fletcher Henderson**: As a bandleader and arranger, Henderson was influential in the development of big band jazz. His band was one of the top African American bands of the 1920s.

# 10. **Ethel Waters**: She was a blues, jazz, and gospel vocalist who became one of the first African American women to be recorded. "Stormy Weather" is one of her most enduring hits, although it was released just slightly later, in 1933.

# This list is just a starting point, as the 1920s were a rich period for music, with various styles emerging and evolving. The era's sound was characterized by the advent of new recording technologies, the rise of radio broadcasting, and the speakeasy culture during Prohibition in the United States.

# Example 5:
#   Prompt: How do I wrap a present neatly?
#   Baseline model: gpt4_1106_preview
#   Baseline model response: Wrapping a present neatly can be quite straightforward with a little practice. Here's a step-by-step guide:

# ### Materials Needed:
# - Wrapping paper
# - Scissors
# - Clear tape
# - The gift to be wrapped
# - Ribbon or bow (optional)
# - Gift tag (optional)

# ### Instructions:

# 1. **Measure the Paper**:
#    - Place the gift on the wrapping paper to measure how much you'll need. You want enough paper to cover the item completely with a little overlap.
#    - Ensure that the paper is long enough to go around the gift with about 2 inches (5 cm) of overlap.
#    - Make sure there's enough paper to cover the ends of the present with extra to fold and tape.

# 2. **Cut the Paper**:
#    - Cut the wrapping paper along a straight line. You can use the grid lines on the back of the paper as a guide if available.

# 3. **Center the Gift**:
#    - Place your gift face down on the wrapping paper. This way, the seam of the paper will be on the bottom of the present.

# 4. **Wrap the Paper Around the Gift**:
#    - Bring the paper around the gift so that it's completely covered.
#    - Pull the paper taut, but be careful not to tear it.
#    - Tape one edge of the paper to the box, then pull the other edge over it to create a seam along the center of the bottom of the box. Tape it down.

# 5. **Fold the Ends**:
#    - At one end of the box, push the sides of the paper inward, creating two flaps and a triangle at the top and bottom.
#    - Fold down the top triangular flap, creasing well, then fold up the bottom triangle. This should create a neat edge.
#    - Secure with tape. Repeat on the other end.

# 6. **Final Touches**:
#    - If there are any untidy edges or corners, you can fold them neatly and secure them with a small piece of tape.
#    - Add a ribbon or bow on top for decoration, and attach a gift tag if needed.

# ### Tips for a Neat Wrap:
# - Use double-sided tape to avoid visible tape lines for a cleaner look.
# - Keep your folds sharp by creasing them with your fingers or the edge of a ruler.
# - If your wrapping paper is wrinkled, you can lightly iron it on a low setting to smooth it out (make sure the paper is iron-safe).
# - Practice makes perfect. Your first few attempts might not be perfect, but you'll improve with each gift you wrap.

# By following these steps, you should be able to neatly wrap your present and give it that professional-looking touch.
